  <p>In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Poor old tree. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.</p>
  <p>Just make a decision and let it go. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.</p>
  <p>Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. This painting comes right out of your heart. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.</p>
  <p>There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. You can spend all day playing with mountains. The least little bit can do so much. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. In life you need colors.</p>
  <p>How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.</p>
  <p>It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</p>
  <p>We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. In this world, everything can be happy. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>
  <p>You can do it. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>
  <p>Let's get crazy. That's crazy. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>
  <p>Let your imagination be your guide. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. You have to make these big decisions. Let's have a nice tree right here.</p>
  <p>Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Just make little strokes like that.</p>
  <p>If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. It's cold, but it's beautiful. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.</p>
  <p>We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. There we go.</p>
  <p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. With practice comes confidence. Learn when to stop.</p>
