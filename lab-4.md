# What is HTML?

The **Hypertext Markup Language** defines the structure and content of
a webpage. In this lab, we'll modify the following small template for an
HTML document and get a better understanding of the structure of HTML.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
   <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Hello, world!</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="...">
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p lang="es">¡Hola, Mundo!</p>
      <p lang="zh">你好，世界</p>
      <p lang="ar" dir="rtl">مرحبا بالعالم!</p>
      <p lang="hi">नमस्ते दुनिया</p>
   </body>
</html>
```

Copy the above example to and paste it into a new text file (use your
favourite text editor). Save that text file as `example.html`. Now open
that file from your file manager. It should open in your default
browser and display something like this:

![The rendered page in my browser](lab-4/example.html.png)

> **Question 1**: When this page opened in your browser, did it use
> HTTP? Provide evidence for your answer (hint: look at the URL).
