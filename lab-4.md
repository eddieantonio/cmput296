-->

<!--

Omit the Host header to example.com

-->

<!-- manually fetch IP addresses with dig -->

<!--

Make them construct an HTTP request


Now, the bytes that your browser sent should be stored in the file
called `request.txt`. Use the `xxd` program to retrieve a hexadecimal
dump of the file's bytes:


```sh
xxd request.txt
```

> **Question 5**. Copy-paste the hex dump retrieved by typing `xxd
> request.txt` in the terminal as the answer to this question.

The hex dump shows three columns, the first is a hexadecimal offset in
the file; the second are the bytes, expressed in hexadecimal, and last
is an ASCII rendering of the bytes, with bytes that cannot be printed as
ASCII replaced by a period (`.`).
