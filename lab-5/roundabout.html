        I'll be the roundabout<br/>
        The words will make you out 'n' out<br/>
        I spend the day your way<br/>
        Call it morning driving through the sound and<br/>
        In and out the valley<br/>
      </p>

      <p class="stanza verse" id="verse-1">
        The music dance and sing<br/>
        They make the children really ring<br/>
        I spend the day your way<br/>
        Call it morning driving through the sound and<br/>
        In and out the valley<br/>
      </p>

      <p class="stanza post-chorus" id="post-chorus-1">
        In and around the lake<br/>
        Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there<br/>
        One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you<br/>
        Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too<br/>
        Twenty four before my love you'll see <br/>
        I'll be there with you<br/>
      </p>

      <p class="stanza verse" id="verse-2">
        I will remember you<br/>
        Your silhouette will charge the view<br/>
        Of distance atmosphere<br/>
        Call it morning driving through the sound and<br/>
        Even in the valley<br/>
      </p>

        Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too<br/>

          Along the drifting cloud <br/>
          The eagle searching down on the land<br/>
          Catching the swirling wind <br/>
          The sailor sees the rim of the land<br/>
          The eagle's dancing wings <br/>
          Create as weather spins out of hand<br/>

          Go closer hold the land <br/>
          Feel partly no more than grains of sand<br/>
          We stand to lose all time <br/>
          A thousand answers by in our hand<br/>
          Next to your deeper fears <br/>
          We stand surrounded by a million years<br/>
          I'll be the roundabout<br/>
          The words will make you out 'n' out<br/>
          I'll be the roundabout<br/>
          The words will make you out 'n' out<br/>
